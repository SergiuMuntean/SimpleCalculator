# My Simple Calculator

By doing this project, I learned how to use the basics of Tkinter and Python, by creating a simple calculator. I used a couple of constructors and Widgets that are implemented in Tkinter. The calculator can do +, -, x, /, and % between multiple numbers of different digits.

## Overview

This is a simple calculator built using Python's Tkinter library. It performs basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and remainder calculation. It also features a clear function to reset the input and a result display for showing the outcome of calculations.

## Features

- **Basic Operations**: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, and Remainder.
- **Clear Function**: Resets the input field.
- **Responsive UI**: Interactive buttons for input and calculations.

## How It Works

1. **User Interaction**: 
   - Users can input numbers and select operations using on-screen buttons.
   - The input is displayed in a text field.
   
2. **Mathematical Operations**:
   - After selecting an operation, the user enters the second number, and the result is shown when the "=" button is pressed.

## Getting Started

To run this calculator:

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
2. Install Tkinter (if not already installed) with:
   ```bash
   pip install tk

3.Run the project in bash: python calculator.py
